# Employee Attrition Analysis

# Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition, identifying the key reasons behind it, and proposing strategies for effective employee retention. Attrition, which can significantly impact organizational costs and performance, is analyzed using machine learning models to predict and understand its main drivers.

# Project Architecture

## Data Source

•	Dataset: IBM Employee Attrition Dataset  
•	Features: 1470 records, 35 features

## Methodology
#### Data Wrangling and Pre-processing  
#### Cleaning:  
Handling missing data, setting correct data types, dropping irrelevant attributes.
#### Encoding: 
Transforming categorical data into binary codes.
	
#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Tools: Power BI for visual insights into the data distribution and relationships.
	
#### Model Development
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest.

Selection: Decision Tree was selected based on its performance in F1-Score and sensitivity, indicating a better balance between precision and recall.

## Tools and Technologies
Python: Main programming language for data wrangling, preprocessing, and model development.

Power BI: Used for creating interactive visualizations for EDA.

## Results & Discussion
The analysis identifies factors both increasing and decreasing the likelihood of attrition, such as distance from work, salary increases, and previous company experiences. These insights help in tailoring more effective employee retention strategies.

## Business Implication
Strategies like holistic compensation approaches, dynamic job evolution, and enhancing retention strategies through technology and culture enhancement are suggested.

## Limitations and Future Scope
Future versions can expand on the dataset to include more diverse roles and explore interdependence between variables using multivariate analysis. Updates to address pre-COVID data and improve inclusivity.
